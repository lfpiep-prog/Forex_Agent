# Professional Documentation

## When to use this skill
- User asks for a README.md.
- User needs a technical report or whitepaper.
- User requests editing or polishing of text.

## Workflow
- [ ] **Outline**: Define the audience, purpose, and key points.
- [ ] **Review Standards**: Check for specific style guides (e.g., Google Style Guide) or templates.
- [ ] **Draft**: Write the content, focusing on clarity and brevity.
- [ ] **Refine**: Remove passive voice, jargon, and fluff.
- [ ] **Format**: Apply Markdown or relevant formatting (headers, lists, code blocks).

## Instructions
1.  **Audience First**: Write for the reader, not the writer.
2.  **Structuring**:
    -   Use `H1` (#) for the main title (one per document).
    -   Use `H2` (##) for major sections.
    -   Use bullet points for lists > 3 items.
3.  **Tone**:

    -   *Marketing*: Engaging, benefit-oriented.
4.  **Formatting**:
    -   Use **bold** for emphasis (sparingly).
    -   Use `backticks` for code elements.
